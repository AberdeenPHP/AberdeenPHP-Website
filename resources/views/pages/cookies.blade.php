                      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                      <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.</p>
                      <p>For more general information on cookies see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies</a>.</p>

                      <h2>The Cookies We Set</h2>
                      <p>Session Cookies - Sometime we might need to remembering who you are. For example if you 'log in' to our website, we set a cookie for a short time to save you having to log in again.</p>
                      <p>Payment Processing - If we process any payments or donations you make our payment provider may insist we set a cookie in order to do so.</p>
                      <p>Development Tools - Occasionally we might temporarily use a tool on the website to test different version of the website and these tools require us to set a cookie.</p>

                      <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
                      <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>
                      <p>Social Media - We may use code from the likes of Facebook or Twitter to add functionality to the website. These companies will set their own cookies.</p>
                      <p>Analytics - In order for us to monitor the usage of our website our analytics provide may need to set a cookie.</p>

                      <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                      <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.

It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>
                      <h2>More Information</h2>
                      <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site. However if you are still looking for more information then you can contact us through one of our preferred contact methods.</p>
                      <h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>
