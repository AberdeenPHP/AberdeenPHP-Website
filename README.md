# Site
Website for AberdeenPHP User Group

## Background
This is the second or thired version of the AberdeenPHP website.  The first was, I think a github pages thing, the second was WordPress, this one is very basic php and HTML.  The reasoning for this is that it should very simple to edit and just plain simple generally. 

## Editing pages
Just edit the php file really.

## Creating a new page 
1. copy an exiting page
2. edit it
3. add it to the menu in common.php

## Tech background
* This uses bootstrap 3.
* The header and footer are just functions in the common.php file.
* Layout is just CSS, no preprocessors are required, just to keep editing simple. So edits go in the file "css/ab_php.css"

## Resources
* It's built using bootstrap 3.3.7, so you can use all the css and components in http://getbootstrap.com/
* I includes Font Awsome 4.6.3, so you can use all the font icons and stuff at http://fontawesome.io/icons/
* It was based on the template at https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog
