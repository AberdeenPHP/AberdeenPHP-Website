# site
Website for AberdeenPHP User Group

## Background
This is the second or thired version of the AberdeenPHP website.  The first was, I think a github pages thing, the second was WordPress, this one is very basic php and HTML.  The reasoning for this is that it should very simple to edit and just plain simple generally. 

## Editing pages
Just edit the php file really

## Creating a new page 
1. copy an exiting page
2. edit it
3. add it to the menu in common.php

## Tech background
This uses bootstrap 3.
the header and footer are just functions in the common.php file.
