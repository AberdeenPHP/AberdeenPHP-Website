# Introduction

### Thank you for getting involved!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AberdeenPHP. It's people like you that keep us going.

### We want to make this easy.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


### Typos, refactoring, tests? Do what you can

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

AberdeenPHP is a community â€” if you are part of that community and want to get involved there are many ways to contribute and support. From writing tutorials or blog posts, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the site itself.

# Ground Rules

### Continuing supporters.

All Content on the site must meet with the community code of conduct [link](http://aberdeenphp.co.uk/code-of-conduct)
beyond that we only have a few requests.

> Responsibilities
* Handle any PR/Issues politely and, where possible, try to resolve issues in a civil manner.
* No dirty washing in public please, if you have issues with individuals involved in the project please contact info@aberdeenphp.co.uk or DM on twitter @aberdeenphp and we will do our best to resolve them.
* If you have issues with design or implementation of the site feel free to raise these as issues or join us [on Slack](https://slack.scotlandphp.co.uk)
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.
